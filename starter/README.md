## Task 1:  Configure Properties

The starter project contains a blank application.properties file.

Provide the appropriate connection url and credentials for Spring to configure your external db as the primary data source.

[ ]  If you want Spring to automatically generate schema for you, set values for initialization-mode and ddl-auto to customize the way Spring generates or updates your schema.

## Task 2: Configure Unit Tests

[<span style="color:red">X</span>]  Create a new application.properties file in your test/resources directory and configure it to use an H2 in-memory database for unit tests.

[ ]  The starter project includes a set of functional tests to help you make sure youâ€™ve met the requirements.

[<span style="color:red">X</span>]  More information can be found about the unit tests and how to run them in the Testing section of the README. They will fail for now because the starter project controller methods are incomplete, but you can use them to check your progress as you go.

[<span style="color:red">X</span>] The starter project also includes a Postman collection under src/main/resource/Udacity.postman_collection.json. Importing this collection into the Postman application will provide you with a variety of requests you can submit. You should use them to confirm functionality of your external data source as you work. You will also find information about the Postman collection in the project README.
